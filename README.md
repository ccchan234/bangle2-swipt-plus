[BJv2, help appreciated] Modify "Swip back to clock" into Up to Down, then ADD Up to Down and others as options.

Hi,

although i think i better finish some code before post here,
as a junior i think posting here 1st is not bad as someone may help.

the app "swip back to clock" is super useful, however for the sci calculator,
which need swip Lt Rt to switch keys, it indeed could be used in "up to down".

thus it would be nice if the app allow choosing the direction, and applyable to the app's list: always on, white list, black list, always off etc.

my plan:
if no other is working on this, i'll try do this (has higher priority than the screen lock indeed)

1. try modify the app to use "Up to Down" instead of "Lt to Rt" first.
then
2. make the 4 list (Lt to Rt's always on, Blk list, White list, always off) into 11 list (Lt to Rt, Rt to Lt, Up to Down, Down to Up) etc.

currently this app is just 200 line + 200 line.
